# Effects and Coeffects

Nexus separates two concerns in function signatures: **coeffects** (what capabilities the function needs from its environment) and **effects** (what observable actions the function performs). This distinction is central to the [design thesis](../design.md#why-coeffects-not-effects) -- every dependency and side effect is declared, not implied.

## Function Signature Shape

```nexus
fn (args...) -> Ret require { Coeffects } effect { Effects }
```

Both clauses are optional. Omitted means empty row (pure function with no requirements).

```nexus
let pure = fn (x: i64) -> i64 do return x + 1 end

let greet = fn (msg: string) -> unit require { Console } do
    Console.println(val: msg)
    return ()
end

let risky = fn () -> unit effect { Exn } do
    raise RuntimeError(msg: [=[oops]=])
end
```

## Builtin Effects

The only builtin effect is `Exn` (exceptions). `try/catch` discharges `Exn` from the protected block:

```nexus
exception NotFound(msg: string)

let search = fn (key: string) -> string effect { Exn } do
    raise NotFound(msg: key)
end

let main = fn () -> unit do
    try
        let _ = search(key: [=[missing]=])
    catch e ->
        match e do
            case NotFound(msg: m) -> ()
            case _ -> ()
        end
    end
    return ()
end
```

Exception declarations extend the builtin `Exn` type:

```nexus
pub exception PermissionDenied(msg: string, code: i64)
```

`raise` is an expression that immediately unwinds to the nearest `catch`. There are no other builtin effects -- all I/O capabilities use the coeffect system.

## Ports

A `port` defines a coeffect interface -- a set of function signatures that must be provided by the environment:

```nexus
pub port Logger do
    fn info(msg: string) -> unit
    fn warn(msg: string) -> unit
end
```

When a function calls `Logger.info(...)`, it must have `Logger` in its `require` row.

Port methods can themselves declare effects and coeffects:

```nexus
pub port Fs do
    fn open_read(path: string) -> %Handle effect { Exn }
    fn read(handle: %Handle) -> { content: string, handle: %Handle }
    fn close(handle: %Handle) -> unit
end
```

## Handlers

A handler is a value that implements all methods of a port:

```nexus
let console_logger = handler Logger require { Console } do
    fn info(msg: string) -> unit do
        Console.println(val: [=[[INFO] ]=] ++ msg)
        return ()
    end
    fn warn(msg: string) -> unit do
        Console.println(val: [=[[WARN] ]=] ++ msg)
        return ()
    end
end

let mock_logger = handler Logger do
    fn info(msg: string) -> unit do return () end
    fn warn(msg: string) -> unit do return () end
end
```

Handler `require { ... }` propagates: injecting `console_logger` adds `Console` to the caller's requirements.

The type checker enforces:
- Handler methods must match port signatures exactly
- All port methods must be implemented (exhaustive)
- Handler method bodies inherit the handler's `require` clause

## Inject

`inject` supplies handler values to a lexical scope, discharging matching `require` entries:

```nexus
inject stdio.system_handler do
    inject console_logger do
        program()    // program's Logger + Console requirements satisfied
    end
end
```

Rules:
- `inject` must reduce requirements -- injecting an unused handler is a type error
- Multiple handlers can be injected in a single `inject` statement: `inject h1, h2 do ... end`
- Handler requirements propagate to the enclosing scope

## Main Constraints

The `main` function has special restrictions:

- Signature: `() -> unit`
- `effect` must be empty (all exceptions must be handled internally)
- `require` may contain any subset of runtime permissions: `{ PermFs, PermNet, PermConsole, PermRandom, PermClock, PermProc }`

```nexus
let main = fn () -> unit require { PermConsole } do
    inject stdio.system_handler do
        Console.println(val: [=[Hello]=])
    end
    return ()
end
```

## Permission Mapping

Runtime permissions (`PermFs`, `PermNet`, etc.) are special coeffects that map to WASI capabilities. They serve as the bridge between the type system and the runtime sandbox. See [WASM and WASI](../env/wasm.md) for the complete mapping table.

## Row Typing

Effect and coeffect rows are checked by row unification (no subtyping). Open rows use tail variables for polymorphism:

```nexus
// This function is polymorphic over additional requirements
let log_and_do = fn <R>(f: () -> unit require { Logger | R }) -> unit require { Logger | R } do
    Logger.info(msg: [=[starting]=])
    f()
    return ()
end
```

Compatibility is structural -- two rows unify if they contain the same entries (order-independent).
